This repository contains a simple Haskell program demonstrating a common error: infinite recursion due to improper handling of the base case in a recursive factorial function.  The `factorialBug.hs` file shows the buggy code, while `factorialSolution.hs` provides a corrected version. This example highlights the importance of carefully considering base cases when working with recursive functions in Haskell.
